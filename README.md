# React 19.2 - Lesson 26 - Manipulating the DOM with Refs

A minimal, ready-to-run project that demonstrates manipulating the DOM with refs:
- Focusing inputs with `useRef`
- Scrolling elements into view
- Forwarding refs to child components
- Measuring elements via `getBoundingClientRect` in `useEffect`

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
# then open the printed local URL (server opens automatically)
```

## Build for production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
